    "title": "Accelerated Failure Of Bearings",
    "description": "Research at the University of Western Australia into the accelerated failure of rolling element bearings in a pump has proved as an interesting test case for the validity of vibration sensors in determining bearing failure. UWA has a Goulds 3196 centrifugal pump (water) which is contained in a simple loop system. The pump is powered by a 1500 W motor, and this pump can be replaced with either failed bearings, or bearings with incorrect lubrication (Eg. mixed lubrication, lubricant packed with dirt). This pump has been used in a mixed grease test, and this pump can be adapted for different trials to fail bearings in an accelerated fashion. Get in touch with the Living Lab to find out if we can find a solution for your problem. ",
