This is followed by the signing of a non-disclosure agreement so that you can safely communicate details with us. The third stage is for us to understand in detail what your product does, its functional specifications and the environment in which it will be deployed. We will then form a joint team to work on developing the test procedures. This is done in a collaborative on-line environment enabling ease of communication between team members. Once drafted the test procedures are approved and executed. Results are rapidly shared with the team members. A final report is co-drafted by the team. ",
