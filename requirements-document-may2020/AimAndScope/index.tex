\section{Aim and Scope}\label{scope}
One  of  the  main  areas  of  development  for  the  Australian  METS  sector  is  WiFi-enabled  digital-electronic  sensing  systems,  commonly  known  as  Internet-of  Things  (IoT)  applications . In  2018  METS  Ignited  issued a  call  for  interested  parties  to  develop  real  or  near  real-world testing environments. Within the two-year Living Lab project launch that year, the project was able to gather and create documentation on procedures for Derisking Mine Site Trials and Accelerated Life Testing. The documentation needed a platform to be able to share with the public as well as to showcase the services and capability of the Living Lab.

This project is focused in developing a web platform to document procedures created by the Living Lab as well as to engage resource companies to get involved with the Living Lab.

The list of documentation that will be showcased are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Common testing procedures in the industry for MEMS-IoT devices
    \item Equipment and Limitation of the Living Lab
    \item Procedures and Standards for ALT testing for MEMS-IoT devices
    \item Administrative, legal, safety, and technical procedures to support university trials and derisk mine site trials
    \item A set of checklists, co-developed with mining and METS companies, for mine site trials
\end{itemize}
For engaging resource companies, and promoting the Living Lab brand. These are what needs to be implemented:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Branding, color, and styling consistent with the existing Living Lab branding
    \item Contact details for the Living Lab Team
    \item Case Studies - previous work of the Living Lab
\end{itemize}
